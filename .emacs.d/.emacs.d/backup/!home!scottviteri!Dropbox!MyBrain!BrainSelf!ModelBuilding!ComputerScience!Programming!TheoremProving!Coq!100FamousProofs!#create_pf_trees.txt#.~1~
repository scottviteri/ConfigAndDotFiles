Some proofs will not be converted by PrintAST.

Every pf that cannot be converted first tries to load opaque def'ns from disk

There are some pfs that can be printed despite having some opaque dependencies

Defn Unfoldable constant:
 defined by Definition or Let, or by a command assimilated to a def'n using Fixpoint, Program Definition, etc, or a pf ended by Defined
 Unfolding a constant means replacing it by its definition

Proof ended by Qed is not unfoldable
Qed, fxn form of let -> Opaque
Defined, let -> Transparent 

There some unfoldable and foldable pfs that can be converted
Transparent means able to be reduced.
 Reduced means replacing name with definition

The Opaque and Transparent commands control reduction strategies

Find out which proofs I can convert:

| Name       | Declaration | Ending | Opaque Deps | Convertible |
|------------+-------------+--------+-------------+-------------|
| appears    | Fixpoint    | end    | None        | Yes         |
| collision  | Fixpoint    | end    | None        | Yes         |
| enumerate  | Fixpoint    | end    | None        | Yes         |
| len_enum   | Lemma       | Qed    | Only Itself | Yes         |
| filter_app | Lemma       | Qed    |             |             |
