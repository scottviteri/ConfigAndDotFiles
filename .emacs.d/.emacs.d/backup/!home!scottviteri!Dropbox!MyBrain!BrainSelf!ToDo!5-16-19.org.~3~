Loop through each node and check if children are a subset.
Wait, this weak notion does not make sense in of itself ...
 Because could match all combinations further down the graph
 Unless counting all of those as 1
 Maybe considering at most one match per node in dag
  If so, look at all structures under node of size |len motif| and check isomorph
  Even more confusing because could come back into self -- more edges but no more nodes
   Same nodes can be connected in different ways?

 Give up on this for now -- move to clustering

* TODO Louvain clustering


* TODO Speed up conversion from lists to DAG
