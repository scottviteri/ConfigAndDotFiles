Subject: Personal Statement Intro

I am motivated to pursue programming language theory because I few it as a sort of unifying framework.
In the words of Per Martin Lof, "a sufficiently expressive programming language is a foundation of mathematics."
As a result, I believe that whatever intellectual challenge or problem I face tomorrow, I will be able to view it through the lens of programming language theory.
The problem that seems most interesting to me is program synthesis -- I see this as both a practical tool for the modern programmer and a tool for the mathematician of tomorrow.
Program synthesis could automate filling in trivial holes in a program by producing a program of the type of the hole.
Program synthesis techniques could help mathematician in creating the subset of programs that take evidence of propositions as input and create evidence of another proposition as output.
