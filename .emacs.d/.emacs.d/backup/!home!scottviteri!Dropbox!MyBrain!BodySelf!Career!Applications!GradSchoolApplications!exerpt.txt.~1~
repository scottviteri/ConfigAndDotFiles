I have a broad background in programming language theory and artificial intelligence, with special emphasis on the problem of program synthesis. During my undergraduate education at MIT, I have contributed to research in AI, robotics, and mathematics. In the interim year, I have been researching approaches to automatic theorem proving at CMU. I am very interested in the problem of how to automatically generate programs, and for me this problem is closely related to the problem of AI. I like to approach these problems at the intersection of several different perspectives including the hierarchical Bayesian approach from Joshua Tenenbaumâ€™s computational cognitive science class, thoughts on general function approximation from Joscha Bach of the Harvard Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, and the story understanding approach to AI of Patrick Winston and the Genesis group. In short, I am interested in working on program synthesis using a combination of symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches.
